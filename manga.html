        <h1 id="ahead1">My Hero Academia (Manga)</h1>
        <p id="para2">My Hero Academia (僕ぼくのヒーローアカデミア Boku no Hīrō Akademia?) is a manga written and illustrated by
            Kohei Horikoshi and is published in Weekly Shonen Jump. The first chapter was published on July 7, 2014, in
            issue 32, 2014 of Weekly Shonen Jump, and the last chapter was published on August 5th, 2024.</p>
        <h2 id="ahead2">History</h2>
        <p id="para2">Before the series was published in Weekly Shonen Jump, Kohei Horikoshi tested My Hero Academia
            ideas in a One-Shot called "My Hero" that was published within Akamaru Jump in Winter 2008.

            After having creating two series in Weekly Shonen Jump that were each eventually cancelled, Oumagadoki Zoo
            which ran for five volumes from 2010-2011, and Barrage which ran for two volumes in 2012, Horikoshi felt he
            was out of ideas. When he was given the opportunity for a third series, he decided to revisit the old "My
            Hero" one-shot, which became the inspiration for the series. Other inspirations would be American films and
            comics, such as Star Wars, Spider-Man, and X-Men, as well as shonen manga like Naruto, Dragon Ball,
            Ultraman, and Kamen Rider.

            Development on the series started in June 2013 before its first chapter was officially released a year later
            in July 2014.

            On January 26, 2015, Viz Media announced that starting on February 9, 2015 of that year, they would
            officially translate the series into English for release in the Viz Shonen Jump.

            On August 7, 2018, My Hero Academia had sold over 16 million copies.

            December 4, 2018 brought another reprint of Volumes 1-20 bringing about 18 million more copies into
            circulation.[1]

            By December 6, 2019, the series had a cumulative 26 million copies in circulation.[2]

            By January 2022, the series has achieved over 65 million copies in circulation worldwide.[3]

            By February 2023, the series has achieved over 85 million copies in circulation worldwide.[4]

            By April 2024, the series has achieved over 100 million copies in circulation worldwide.[5]</p>
        <h2 id="ahead2">Plot</h2>
        <p id="para2">People are not born equal, a realization that four-year-old Izuku Midoriya faced when bullied by
            his classmates who had unique special powers. Izuku was one of the rare cases where he was born with
            absolutely no unique powers. This did not stop Izuku from pursuing his dream, a dream of becoming a great
            hero like the legendary All Might. To become the great hero he hopelessly wants to become, he will now join
            the ranks of one of the highest rated "Hero Academies" in the country: U.A. High School. With the help of
            his idol All Might, will he be able to claim the ranks and become a true hero?</p>
        <h2 id="ahead2">Style</h2>
        <p id="para2">The manga takes various cues and styling from American comics. It also breaks away from the idea
            of the battle manga main protagonist cliché who is normally very powerful and wild from the start.</p>
