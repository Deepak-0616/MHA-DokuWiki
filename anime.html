        <p id="para2">Izuku Midoriya is a boy who wishes to become a hero just like his idol, All Might, however lacking
            a Quirk makes the dream feel impossible, and makes him an easy target for bullying, like from his childhood
            friend, Katsuki Bakugo. However, after an incident where Izuku meets All Might, he proves himself worthy of
            becoming a hero, and is chosen as All Might's successor to inherit his Quirk, One For All, which allows him
            to get accepted to U.A. High School, and learn how to become a true hero.</p>
